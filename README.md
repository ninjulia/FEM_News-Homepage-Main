## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first time using grid for one of these challenges. Since I'm not as comfortable with the syntax, I'm sure I overused the grid-template-column/row declarations.

In addition to crafting the min / max design views, I improvised new layouts for some sections with breakpoints at 576px & 768px. For the "New" section, I opted to use column-count instead of flex or grid because I could leverage the sweet column-rule property.

### Continued development

More practice with grid and mobile navigation layouts is needed. I'm not excited about my use of various rem sizes, ideally there should be more repeated values for a consistent design.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive navbar tutorial using HTML CSS & JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0) - I used the basic HTML and JS structure from this video. Kevin also provides advice for keeping accessibility in mind.
